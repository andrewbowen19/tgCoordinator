Have a script currently that is interactive (through terminal) for users. Would like to make the interface much cleaner (testing repo - popup). Also in the process of cleaning up the name-search matching (for bad names in database/search)
COuld eventually turn this into a mac OS app.

9/9/19 Update:
Interactive while loop is working (guide-feedback.py). Working on developing user-friendly GUI for guide search

9/23/19 Update:
Search class is working, considering trying out the py2app converter to turn this into an .exe file. 
This would be so guides can download the applet in order to view their feedback -- would need to restructure the search function to limit guides search capabilities.

Meeting with Hillary and the other coords today, planning to demonstrate and get feedback/ideas.
