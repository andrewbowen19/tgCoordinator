For the other answers, there was a lot of personal reflection about the college transition/experience in general, but they didn't give enough specific detail about Northwestern for me. I got the sense that they could potentially be trained to be a good TG.",,Bienen,Music Cognition; Psychology and Communication Sciences and Disorders minors
