The answers all had a similar tone which was very computer science/start-up focus, so it'd be interesting to see if they could speak to other aspects of NU in the interview. I don’t think I’d be ready to hire them right now, but there was a lot of effort in the application that shows potential, so I think the interview could be beneficial to see if they could elaborate",,MEAS,"Computer Science, Statistics, Minor in Business German"

I worry that this person might be a little too negative, but the rest of the application is strong, so I would count them out yet",,WCAS,"German, Minors in Chemistry and History"

I’m the tiniest bit worried about how they write about failure, but I don’t think it’s the end all be all. The application itself wasn’t very creative, but that might just be their writing skills so I’d still want to see them in an interview",,Medill,Journalism

The answer to the lesson question was particularly weak, as they only spoke about their experience during the polar vortex and didn’t relate it to the rest of the NU experience. I wouldn’t be ready to hire them at this time",,SOC,Theater

Her response to the rebranding question was more of a ""how would you change Northwestern"" answer, so it felt a little negative, and although that may have been the interpretation of the question, it wasn't spun well. However, the answers to the first two questions were well-written and enthusiastic, so I wouldn't be opposed to seeing her get an interview",,SOC,"Theater, Minor in French, Acting for the Screen Module, Kaplan Humanities Scholars Program"

The slogan question played off of NU's ""rivalry"" with U Chicago, which felt a little uncomfortable, and that same question wasn't fleshed out, and the enthusiasm was hesitant; there was enthusiasm in some of the other questions, but this one answer just stuck out most to me",,WCAS,Neuroscience
