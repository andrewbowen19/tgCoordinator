I can tell this person put in a lot of effort to be creative, but potentially at the expense of the application. For example, her whole ""coolest lesson"" was power posing which is cool, but it was in context of facing Northwestern's negative things.",,SOC,RTVF

I really liked that this person really emphasized that NU isn't just a good school but ALSO has dope people that give this place a personality. Very good rebrand NU explanation- if cheesy.

YES i want someone to say this to a potential family, and I think the fact that she is English and Psych but talks about trying a coding class and learning a language really shows that lesson in action.",,WCAS,"English, Psych"
