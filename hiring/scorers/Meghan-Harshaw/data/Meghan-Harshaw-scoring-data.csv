The applicant mentions a class they took as their most important lesson, which I guess is NU specific, but that's about it. They also answered the question about their favorite activity as a cappella but then clarify they are not in an a cappella group, which is a little confusing. It seems odd that the application was so short when they are a Journalism major (clearly capable of writing and being engaging). Other than that, not much else I have to say.
