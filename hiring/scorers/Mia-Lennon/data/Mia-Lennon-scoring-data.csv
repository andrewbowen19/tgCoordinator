She points out potential difficulties with the school (IE overwhelming amount of things to do that can lead to FOMO, initially feeling like an outsider in some communities), but provides excellent spin on how people take initiative to make their Northwestern experience the best it could be. The only thing that kept her from some 4s turning into 5s was a little lack of specificity in naming student organizations, but honestly if I could do like a 4.5 I would.

However, I was turned off by the fact that their other two answers were not even a sentence long each, and even though they kind of spoke to truths about NU, I worry about the commitment and dedication to actually filling out the application and thus to the TG program itself.",,SESP,"LOC, Entrepreneurship Minor, Segal Design Certificate"
