They don't have any declared field of study yet (and didn't mention an intended one) and the only campus involvement they mentioned was with their residence hall. While their answers were sweet and enthusiastic, the re-branding question specifically made it clear to me that they just don't know nearly enough about Northwestern yet or has enough of a sense about the specifics about what the university has to offer.",,WCAS,Undeclared

Other than that, a lot of this application was very vague and didn't really speak to a broader Northwestern community. The video especially didn't give me any insight on how that experience could relate to Northwestern or prospective students. Because they're only in their freshman year, they talk a lot about high school which isn't very helpful. Their choice question didn't give me much insight into their personality/passions.",,WCAS,"Biology and Psychology major, Chemistry minor"

They were very intentional with every question and I feel like a really got a sense of this person's passion and originality. The re-branding question was the weakest for me, but I think some of that could be taught. While they didn't provide a ton of writing, the choice question specifically gave me a lot of insight into the type of thinker they are, and I was definitely interested in hearing more from them.",,SESP,"Social Policy, International Studies"

Their choice question was also very cool and intellectual. They seem to me to have an interesting and original voice. I think they would need a little more teaching on general Northwestern things and how to spin even better than they already do. I would be interested in hearing more from them.,,SOC,"Theatre, Physics"

They already speak like a tour guide in terms of using very personal and Northwestern-specific examples to speak to a broader university feel and communal spirit.

The language they used and the structure of their answers was so difficult that I had to read it multiple times over to have any idea what they were fundamentally getting at.

I truly almost cried reading this application and watching the video especially.
