Directory for us to play around with comment sentiment analysis
Using nltk python package to do NLP on visitor comments

Using comment data from Hillary to train models

'classification' subdir holds all scripts/data files with tour comments and classified positive and negative comment sjson files
.JSON files are to be used as training data for our models
Might be undertraining with only ~100 comments but ahhhhhhhhh that's the way it goes




TODO: Rewrite commentAnalyzer to only train model once then use for comments
- Implement basic GUI for demo with dev team
