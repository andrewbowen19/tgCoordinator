Nothing stands out, the tour guides were not great speakers. Perhaps better speech presenters are needed or study the skill in order to present the school at it's best. As a HS speech analyst, I'd say it was very hard to listen to them speak. They were over the top and almost silly.
It focused more on the arts than most other schools (likely because it has a bigger presence at your school than most). However, I wish we would have been shown more of the campus (we were only shown the southern third of campus). I also wish we were shown more of the academic buildings and were able to see inside.
