without a doubt, the lakefront views and the relaxed feeling from the tour guide
It was very informative and welcoming.
Great tour guide, awesome campus
The tour guides really knew what they were talking about, and the presenter was really funny and personable. All the presenters I've seen at other schools weren't as fun as he was.
The guide actually allowed us into a classroom and let us have a dedicated question session, and the guide seemed much more genuine than the rest of my tour guides, especially in explaining why they chose Northwestern.
Once again I think the tour guides were not only extremely informative, but also shared with us their personal experiences, which gave us a different perspective of the school. Overall, great tour!
My tour guide was awesome  he took the time to answer everyone's specific questions and made me fall in love with the campus and community. He showed that he cares about the school and that he is proud to go there. This tour solidified Northwestern's place as my first-choice school.
I feel Northwesterns tour made sure to create a welcoming, yet realistic view of the environment Northwestern holds.
I liked that the tour guide was very focused on personalizing the tour and answering all the questions asked. She did her best to keep the group engaged and I really liked how she spoke a lot about the different traditions around campus because I feel like a schools traditions is really one major thing that sets it apart from other schools for me. I also enjoyed how we got to spend times inside and out of buildings because I have felt that in many other tours I have been only shown the facade of different academic buildings, but on my tour at Northwestern I was shown the inside of various academic centers and I even got to see the commons and a typical classroom!
