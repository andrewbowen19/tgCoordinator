"without a doubt, the lakefront views and the relaxed feeling from the tour guide"
It was very informative and welcoming.
"Great tour guide, awesome campus"
"The tour guides really knew what they were talking about, and Skylar was really funny and personable. All the presenters I've seen at other schools weren't as fun as he was."
"The guide actually allowed us into a classroom and let us have a dedicated question session, and the guide seemed much more genuine than the rest of my tour guides, especially in explaining why they chose Northwestern."
"Once again I think the tour guides were not only extremely informative, but also shared with us their personal experiences, which gave us a different perspective of the school. Overall, great tour!"
"My tour guide (I don't remember his name but he is a political science, history, and legal studies student from Colorado) was awesome – he took the time to answer everyone's specific questions and made me fall in love with the campus and community. He showed that he cares about the school and that he is proud to go there. This tour solidified Northwestern's place as my first-choice school."
"I feel Northwestern's tour made sure to create a welcoming, yet realistic view of the environment Northwestern holds."
"I liked that the tour guide was very focused on personalizing the tour and answering all the questions asked. She did her best to keep the group engaged and I really liked how she spoke a lot about the different traditions around campus because I feel like a school’s traditions is really one major thing that sets it apart from other schools for me. I also enjoyed how we got to spend times inside and out of buildings because I have felt that in many other tours I have been only shown the facade of different academic buildings, but on my tour at Northwestern I was shown the inside of various academic centers and I even got to see the commons and a typical classroom!"
"The Northwestern tour stood out because of the tour's ability to allow the visitors to get a real taste of what going to Northwestern is really like! For example, we sat in a Northwestern classroom for part of the tour, which allowed me to think about my life if I were to attend this university."
"Nothing stands out, the tour guides were not great speakers. Perhaps better speech presenters are needed or study the skill in order to present the school at it's best. As a HS speech analyst, I'd say it was very hard to listen to them speak. They were over the top and almost silly."
"It focused more on the arts than most other schools (likely because it has a bigger presence at your school than most). However, I wish we would have been shown more of the campus (we were only shown the southern third of campus). I also wish we were shown more of the academic buildings and were able to see inside."
We had a wonderful tour guide who had a ton of energy and enthusiasm. She was super encouraging and more than willing to answer any and all questions. Overall the visit was a fantastic experience!
"For most part showed nice overview of everything. However, didn't show dorms which was dissapointing"
The tour gave a lot of information about the academics. There was not much said about the social life
"I liked being able to choose a tour guide based on my interests because I was able to pick someone who was on a path of study similar to what I intend to study, especially in regards to the School of Education and Social Policy."
"As an alum who have brought her child to the campus a number of times, we were disappointed for others ... never stepped inside the Deering, no explanation of the clubs, groups, Greek life, no visit to any dorms. No conversation of the school history/building and all the exciting new buildings."
The way my tour guide was able to share her personal experiences and the experiences of people she knew made the entire thing feel mor expresó al and less like it was something she had memorized.
Nothing about the tour stood out. Campus was main attraction.
"The tour guide  was exceptionally amiable, as well as knowledgeable, and walking alongside the partially frozen Lake Michigan was mesmerising."
"I would say that the tour guides ability to give relevant and helpful insight on their time at Northwestern, what opportunities they were a part of, etc., made Northwestern’s tour stand out."
I liked that we went inside buildings.
"The positive guides, clear overview of course structure, and breadth of classes made it clear to me what classes I would take and that I would fit in with the Wildcats."
Upbeat and friendly tour guides
"The student-led tour was potentially one of the best I’ve been on, of all the ones I’ve gone. She was quite charismatic, knew a lot of what she was talking about/the campus, gave us a broad look at everything there was to see at Northwestern. The information session was quite nice, too— the two speakers were charismatic, funny. Great time overall! Didn’t talk a ton about student life, though: would’ve liked to see more about the dorms & activities available for students on campus, but that wasn’t a make-or-break for me."
How personable the tour guides were. I stayed after and had a very informative and enjoyable conversation with my tour guide that helped me feel connected to the school as a whole.
"They didn’t show us a dorm or a dining hall, which I feel is a pretty important part of getting a feel of campus."
"I feel like the tour guides where not passionate about their university. I had dreamed of going here but after the tour, I felt as if my expectations were not met. I felt like the students were not passionate about going there. I would find more passionate and enthusiastic students."
"My tour guide made sure to mention specific traditions and academic programs. As a result, I was able to truly understand both the social and academic atmospheres of Northwestern."
"Overall, I feel like Northwestern’s tour was very genuine and honest about what it’s like being a student at and what they have to offer for undergraduates."
"The exceptionally strong passion and pride from both the presenters and the tour guides towards Northwestern(and their enthusiasm imbued me a lot); the chance to go inside buildings such as the dining hall and even real classrooms of Weinberg College of Arts and Sciences.    p.s The tour guides popping in with ""Go Cats!"" was just great!"
The energy that the tour guides expressed was awesome. They really made the tour feel enjoyable.
My tour guide compellingly talked about the social and residential aspects of Northwestern that you cannot find on a website.
The tour guide who gave the tour was extremely passionate and I enjoyed listening him talk about his experience as a poli sci major.
"All the tour guide choices were from other than engineering,  so we didn't feel we had an opportunity to tour with someone in area of interest."
"I really liked how warm and outgoing the tour leaders were. However, I wish we would have been able to go inside the dorms or libraries to see more of what the University is like from the inside."
"We drove a long ways to get here. We spent most of the tour outside. When asked if u can see a dorm, we were told look online. I could look online for everything. I saw the outdoor area. Why can’t I see inside any schools of interest? Divide us up by what interests us and let’s see the inside of buildings. I was told to schedule a purple day. Super nice outside of buildings. Also how many people in the room were dancers? Loyola  took us inside buildings that we were interested in. Hands down more inclusive. Super bummed about your tour."
"I feel my tour guide helped me understand better a lot of the academic options at Northwestern. I am very interested in the MMSS pathway, so it was very interesting to learn about that."
I believe it was the amount of interior I was able to see. After being on numerous college tours and eventually attending a university for my freshman year it is important to see the facilities first hand in order to get a sense of atmosphere. I was disappointed with the lack of information for aspiring transfer students.
It was very rehearsed and seemed a bit unnatural
"I really liked how you could pick your own adventure, in terms of selecting your own tour guide. Not many other college visits let you do that. However, I hoped there would be a more variety of student tour guides to choose from (in terms of studies, ethnicity, and identity). "
We didn’t go into many of the buildings on the tour. We stayed outside and I felt like I didn’t learn enough about campus life.
"The personal feel that all the guides and speakers created was great. They really emphasized the community aspect of the school as well as the ability to explore all of your interests at Northwestern. I left, despite already wanting to go there, feeling like it was a perfect match for me."
"From the time when the guides ran up to the front of the room, I could tell each one truly loved Northwestern. Their passion for their school demonstrated the value of a Northwestern education. The guide was also very polished, but relatable."
All of the tour guides had a theatre background which didn't resonate with me.
Shorter than other tours and we only covered a small portion of campus. At the end I felt like Northwestern’s campus is very small or we did not get to see much of it. Mostly due to very windy very cold weather maybe?
I enjoyed the tour guides because they were very excited and joyful!
The tour guides guide was abysmally informed. 
"On a tour, it is particularly great when you see the way the school has touched the heart of its students. As a prospective student, I want to find a school where I feel excited about new challenges, because of the supportive academic and social environment. Unlike any other tour I have been on, Northwestern's students, and especially my tour guide, radiated that excitement. The students, especially Serena and Simone, demonstrated a love for the work they were completing and the place they were studying. Northwestern's tour made it evident that the school was there for the students, and I have never been on a tour that demonstrated that level of commitment."
"My only critique would be that the guide spoke about himself way too much, and I would have liked to hear more about the buildings, traditions, classes, etc. And less about him, but overall I love the campus."
"Wish we would’ve gone in a dorm, rec center, library, the arch etc. Felt like we barely saw anything. Our tour guide was very focused on Theater, which really had little relevance to us. Info session was fine, but didn’t get a great sense that there is a lot of school spirit."
"I’m not sure of the reason, but my tour guide did not take my group into any buildings, so I felt I didn’t get a proper representation of  Northwestern. I left disappointed. "
"At our tour we only went into two buildings so going into buildings such as the library, a cafeteria, a gathering space for students, an athletic facility, and a dorm would be especially helpful for understanding life at Northwestern. I was also not able to see a classroom so that would be helpful as well. Although, I do understand that viewing a classroom is a part of the tour, we were just not able to see one because they were full. Thank you for your time!"
"Although all tours strive to achieve the same goals and cover similar topics, Northwestern’s tour stood apart because, although I had stayed at Northwestern for three weeks before, I learned so much new things. It also stood apart in just the way the presentation was presented and also how  inviting the tour guides and other passerby were."
Our guide was very friendly
"The tour guide was very mindful of talking to the whole group and moving at a friendly pace. She also represented many parts of all that Northwestern has to offer, so she had plenty of first-hand knowledge of the school. I also liked that we got to pick our tour guide!"
"I really enjoyed that they spoke on the academic side of things. Most colleges talk about only community, and community is great, but I think the tour provided a great balance of info on both which I really liked."
Our guide had a great attitude and instead of focusing solely on academics and sports he instead discussed the community in addition to those other things.
My tour guide was very good at combining the academic life of a student with Northwestern's social opportunities and the campus itself is beautiful.
"Northwestern's tour stood apart from others because it focused on specific special opportunities for students that only Northwestern offers. Hearing about research projects, as well as businesses created by student entrepreneur, gave me a better sense of why Northwestern is different and what the school as to offer. Thank you for a wonderful tour!"
"Our tour guide could’ve been more succinct and clearer. There was too much repetition in information and not enough information in general. She did not provide any specifics, instead supplemented with personal, subjective ideas (such as how she loved her friends and her advisors). She did not do a very good job answering questions as there was so much extra, unnecessary information that did not apply. I did not walk away with a good idea of how Northwestern could help me. She used crutch words frequently making it hard to understand."
"I really liked the way we were brought to a classroom to sit and ask questions. Also, my tour guide had somewhere to be but she was still very patient and made sure we all got our questions answered. What I really wish is that my tour guide had pointed out specific school buildings since she only pointed out the libraries."
The students seemed genuinely happy At Northwestern and it was apparent that all of the students love this school.
"It did not feel much different from other college tour, I feel that it was very rushed, and that the groups were to large to get a feel for the campus."
"The Northwestern tour stood apart from other campus tours because it was very personable. There were many opportunities to ask questions, creating an open atmosphere. The tour staff also addressed that it was perfectly fine to have an undecided major. Having flexibility between majors is a great opportunity to have."
the tour guide's enthusiasm and ability to spark inspiration
Tremendous positive energy and coordination from presenters
"Our tour guide let us peek in at an ongoing class at Northwestern, which was not necessarily available at other universities."
The tour wasn’t very great. We only got to see like 1/15th of the actual campus and student life.
"In every other campus tour I've taken there were significantly more opportunities to visit the actual academic spaces, not just the outside of buildings."
"Northwestern’s tour featured students who truly took advantage of what the school has to offer and were thus able to paint a complete image of what student life might look like. With so many schools offering innumerable opportunities for students, what stood out to me was the students themselves."
"You need more  guys as tour guides.  Also, I know Northwestern has a lot of theater people.  It would be good to have some athletes, or some people who talk about some fun stuff happening.  I know it's an awesome school; but, I'd like to have a little fun, too.  It comes off as very, very intense."
Northwestern’s tour stood out from other campus tours in that it highlighted students personal experiences with the school itself. It gave me first hand accounts of what it is like to live and thrive in Northwestern.
"As mentioned before, the tour guides were both very knowledgeable and approachable. They were very helpful when I asked questions and explained a lot about the University."
"It did a good job of discussing both academics and student life, and not too much of one over the other. I learnt a lot and got a good idea of what it would be like to attend here."
I really liked how the guide talked a lot about academics and campus traditions. I thought we got a lot more information about academics in the Northwestern tour than other tours which I really liked.
"The tour guide was rather quiet and I felt as though I was not shown the best assets of the university. I saw mostly concrete buildings and a few pretty buildings. It did not highlight the campus very well but at least it showed me why I wouldn’t live the campus as much as other colleges. Also, there were absolutely no students walking around which is odd. I think Northwestern is a great school but I will most definitely not be applying after experiencing the feel of the campus and the students that attend northwestern."
"We did not get to see what a typical residence area would look like, we did not get much information on student dining areas, but it is truly a beautiful campus with its plethora of green and location on lake michigan’s shore."
"This tour stood out to me specifically because I could see the fun and sense of community that encompassed everything. From academics to campus life, my tour guide was enthusiastic and energetic about everything."
"What stood out to me the most about this tour was that my guide was extremely passionate about her studies at NU. Every time she talked about what she has done at Northwestern, she smiled. Her energy was extremely contagious. It made me feel even more excited to apply to NU."
"On one hand, I think it would be hard to mess up a tour when you have a campus that is that beautiful and well located. But I think the biggest factor was how personable the tour guide felt and how he interacted with actual college students walking around next to our tour. It gave the campus a sense of unity and I really enjoyed the community feel."
It was missing some key components that I only realized as I was leaving. The tour covered very little of the campus.
"I think the tour was not as informative as it could have been. We didn’t really look at any academic buildings except the libraries and I would have like to see which buildings were part of each college. That being said, the information session was certainly the best I have seen, it contained all the information I wanted and much more."
"Northwestern’s tour significantly increased my interest in the school, due to the constant reminder that students are free to branch off into any school or class that interests them at the university. There are no barriers based on what college you are in, and that being explained on the tour opened my perspective on the school, as it is very interdisciplinary, something that I love."
"The guide was not bad but did not seem like he wanted to be there. The tour seemed very rehearsed, the guide often provided the information and would not go much deeper. Also the guide shadowing seemed to have more energy and want to share his experiences but did not talk on them as much as he could have. Regardless, the tour was still great because it answered all the questions and highlighted all the points of Northwestern I was interested in; the academics, the community, and the facilities."
"It didn’t include anything normal... no residence hall, no student union, no classroom/lecture hall, no dining hall, nothing that I was expecting  They mentioned a cappella lots of times..."
"The time set aide for questions with the tour guide was lovely. Often, people have many lingering questions without easy times to ask them, and this time was lovely to get some of those answered. I also loved the tour of the grounds."
"The energy and enthusiasm that the Northwestern students had when talking about their classes, community, and school really excited me!"
"What particularly stood out to me was how the tour guide took the group into an actual classroom. Other schools don’t usually do this, so it was a nice thing for Northwestern to add. Another thing that stood out is how they talked about the surrounding area a lot. Many schools focus on the campus and fail to speak about what is beyond the campus. I really enjoyed how Northwestern spoke about Evanston and Chicago."
"Northwestern's tour stood out because the students knew the history of the university and could speak to many different aspects of the campus. Student tour guides expanded upon many unique aspects of Northwestern, including the quarter system, which was integral in aiding to my knowledge of the university."
"All of the tour guides seemed to have a lot of energy and were really positive. My only issue is that the tour didn’t extend to the north side of campus, due to time constraints, but in doing that missed a lot of important components of campus (dorms, dining halls, athletic facilities, etc)."
"Other than how personalized the tour was, I feel like a stand out aspect of the tour was how insighful my tour guide was in answering my questions. She went into detail and did a great job offering her knowledge of Northwestern when asked questions by myself and others on the tour, which was something that I found extremely helpful."
"Northwestern's tour was incredibly impressive with their emphasis on the interconnectedness of the schools, and the tour guide's willingness to share different resources with me and put me in touch with their contacts."
"I really loved the way how my tour guide emphasized how Northwestern not only pushes students to excel in academics, but to also be confident in diversifying their interests through double majors and explore their talents in a way where there is constant university support.  There have not been any other schools that have made me feel that I can be adventurous and willingly pushed out of my comfort zone to take courses that have nothing to do with my primary major, or to attempt new activities that are an engaging learning experience."
"I wish my tour guide had taken us around more of the campus. Granted, it was very hot that day, but we only did a short loop around the southern bit of campus and then sat in a classroom for a good 30 minutes. This limit, combined with the fact that it was summer and there were no students, made it really difficult to see myself at Northwestern."
"Northwestern had the most lively, energetic, inspiring tour guides I've seen out of all my college trips. My tour guide made the trip for me and at the beginning of our tour I could immediately tell that I was going to go straight home and get to work on my application. Small things like having a slideshow and videos at the info session made a big difference, because although I didn't give it much thought at the time, visiting other schools where the info sessions consisted of one person standing and talking to us really made Northwestern stand out to me. Also, even the vibe of the other people on the tour made Northwestern stand out, as they were probably the most interesting, active group I've been in, and the small tour group sizes allowed me to get to know (in a tiny way) some of the other really cool people on the tour with me."
"They focused on aspects of student life and academics that are common to everyone. Colleges that seem to be favoring certain groups make others feel like they don’t have a place there. Also, I loved how they talked about it being ok if you come to college and don’t know what you want to study. They also highlighted how the quarter system encourages and allows for exploration. This was really compelling. At other schools, you feel like everyone has it figured out before they get there. Also, the tour guide was awesome. Completely down to earth and relatable to everyone. He tried really hard to answer many diverse questions from a wide variety of students."
This tour was the best college tour that I’ve been on. The information session was very engaging and the speakers were so funny (which was quite the added bonus). I also really enjoyed the examples they gave of student life and they clearly painted a picture of how Northwestern student life seems to be. The tour guides’ enthusiasm as they were introducing themselves and throughout the tour made me want to be apart of the Northwestern community as a student as well.
The inclusivity of the students to the tour guides stood apart from other schools as I felt that my group was small enough for me to ask questions and hear everything perfectly.
"I was surprised about how much our tour guide did not mention during the tour.  After the tour I realized how much we didn't see or talk about, for example, a dining hall and a library which is something that has always been in the tours I have seen in the past.  In addition, she barely spoke about her classmates or professors and I felt that it was all focused on the campus, Chicago and the lake."
