without a doubt, the lakefront views and the relaxed feeling from the tour guide
It was very informative and welcoming.
Great tour guide, awesome campus
The tour guides really knew what they were talking about, and Skylar was really funny and personable. All the presenters I've seen at other schools weren't as fun as he was.
The guide actually allowed us into a classroom and let us have a dedicated question session, and the guide seemed much more genuine than the rest of my tour guides, especially in explaining why they chose Northwestern.
Once again I think the tour guides were not only extremely informative, but also shared with us their personal experiences, which gave us a different perspective of the school. Overall, great tour!
My tour guide (I don't remember his name but he is a political science, history, and legal studies student from Colorado) was awesome  he took the time to answer everyone's specific questions and made me fall in love with the campus and community. He showed that he cares about the school and that he is proud to go there. This tour solidified Northwestern's place as my first-choice school.
I feel Northwestern's tour made sure to create a welcoming, yet realistic view of the environment Northwestern holds.
