I liked that the tour guide was very focused on personalizing the tour and answering all the questions asked. She did her best to keep the group engaged and I really liked how she spoke a lot about the different traditions around campus because I feel like a schools traditions is really one major thing that sets it apart from other schools for me. I also enjoyed how we got to spend times inside and out of buildings because I have felt that in many other tours I have been only shown the facade of different academic buildings, but on my tour at Northwestern I was shown the inside of various academic centers and I even got to see the commons and a typical classroom!
