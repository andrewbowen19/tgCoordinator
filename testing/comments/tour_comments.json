My tour guide made the trip for me and at the beginning of our tour I could immediately tell that I was going to go straight home and get to work on my application. Small things like having a slideshow and videos at the info session made a big difference, because although I didn't give it much thought at the time, visiting other schools where the info sessions consisted of one person standing and talking to us really made Northwestern stand out to me. Also, even the vibe of the other people on the tour made Northwestern stand out, as they were probably the most interesting, active group I've been in, and the small tour group sizes allowed me to get to know (in a tiny way) some of the other really cool people on the tour with me.",

Also, I loved how they talked about it being ok if you come to college and dont know what you want to study. They also highlighted how the quarter system encourages and allows for exploration. This was really compelling. At other schools, you feel like everyone has it figured out before they get there. Also, the tour guide was awesome. Completely down to earth and relatable to everyone. He tried really hard to answer many diverse questions from a wide variety of students.",

I also really enjoyed the examples they gave of student life and they clearly painted a picture of how Northwestern student life seems to be. The tour guides enthusiasm as they were introducing themselves and throughout the tour made me want to be apart of the Northwestern community as a student as well.",

After the tour I realized how much we didn't see or talk about, for example, a dining hall and a library which is something that has always been in the tours I have seen in the past.  In addition, she barely spoke about her classmates or professors and I felt that it was all focused on the campus, Chicago and the lake."
